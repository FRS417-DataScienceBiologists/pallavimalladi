Box office earnings for Star Wars movies (in millions!).
```{r}
new_hope <- c(460.998, 314.4)
empire_strikes <- c(290.475, 247.900)
return_jedi <- c(309.306, 165.8)
```
## Print all the earnings of the 3 matrices together
```{r}
box_office <- c(new_hope, empire_strikes, return_jedi)
box_office
```
## Construct star_wars_matrix.
```{r}
star_wars_matrix <- matrix(box_office,nrow=3,byrow=T)
star_wars_matrix
```
## Vectors region and titles, used for naming.
```{r}
region <- c("US", "non-US")
titles <- c("A New Hope", "The Empire Strikes Back", "Return of the Jedi")
```

## Name the columns with region.
```{r}
colnames(star_wars_matrix)<-region
```

## Name the rows with titles.
```{r}
rownames(star_wars_matrix)<-titles
```

## Print star_wars_matrix.
```{r}
star_wars_matrix
```
## Essentially, what we have done is organize the data matrix by renaming rows and columns
## data restricted by same type (all the values in this matrix are numerics)
```{r}
rowSums (star_wars_matrix)
```
## Once you have a data matrix, you can perform lots of different functions. For example, you can calculate the total earnings of each movie.
```{r}
worldwide_vector <- rowSums(star_wars_matrix)
worldwide_vector
```
## And even add a new column to reflect this calculation. `cbind()` adds columns.
```{r}
all_wars_matrix <- cbind(star_wars_matrix,worldwide_vector)
all_wars_matrix
```

## We can combine additional data. `rbind()` adds rows.
```{r}
the_phantom_menace <- c(474.5, 552.5)
attack_of_the_clones <- c(310.7, 338.7)
revenge_of_the_sith <- c(380.3, 468.5)
box_office2 <- c(the_phantom_menace, attack_of_the_clones, revenge_of_the_sith)
star_wars_matrix2 <- matrix(box_office2,nrow=3,byrow=T ## T means true; do we want to organize by row? Yes!)
colnames(star_wars_matrix2)<-region

titles2 <- c("The Phantom Menace", "Attack of the Clones", "Revenge of the Sith")
rownames(star_wars_matrix2)<-titles2

all_wars_matrix2 <- rbind(star_wars_matrix, star_wars_matrix2)
all_wars_matrix2
```
## Includes the earnings from the last 3 movies together
##The same methods of selecting variables in a vector apply.
```{r}
all_wars_matrix2[1,2]
```

## Practice
Below are data collected by three scientists (Jill, Steve, Susan in order) measuring temperatures of eight hot springs.
```{r}
spring_1 <- c(36.25, 35.40, 35.30)
spring_2 <- c(35.15, 35.35, 33.35)
spring_3 <- c(30.70, 29.65, 29.20)
spring_4 <- c(39.70, 40.05, 38.65)
spring_5 <- c(31.85, 31.40, 29.30)
spring_6 <- c(30.20, 30.65, 29.75)
spring_7 <- c(32.90, 32.50, 32.80)
spring_8 <- c(36.80, 36.45, 33.15)
```

Build a data matrix that has the columns named by scientist and rows by the names of the springs.
```{r}
springs <- c(spring_1, spring_2, spring_3, spring_4, spring_5, spring_6, spring_7, spring_8)
springs <- 
```






```{r}
springs <- c(spring_1, spring_2, spring_3, spring_4, spring_5, spring_6, spring_7, spring_8)
springs_matrix <- matrix(springs, nrow=8, byrow = T)
```

```{r}
scientists <- c("Jill", "Steve", "Susan")
springs <- c("Bluebell Spring", "Opal Spring", "Riverside Spring", "Too Hot Spring", "Mystery Spring", "Emerald Spring", "Black Spring", "Pearl Spring")
```

```{r}
colnames(springs_matrix) <- scientists
rownames(springs_matrix) <- springs
springs_matrix
```

Calculate the mean temperature of all three springs and add it as a new column.
```{r}
mean_vector <- rowMeans(springs_matrix)
mean_vector
```

```{r}
springs_matrix2 <- cbind(springs_matrix, mean_vector)
scientists2 <- c("Jill", "Steve", "Susan", "Mean")
colnames(springs_matrix2) <- scientists2
springs_matrix2
```

## Final Notes on Data Matrices
Working with data matrices requires all of the data to be of the same type. For some applications they are routinely used and many packages require data to be stored as a matrix. Many programmers would also point out that data matrices are more efficient when compared to data frames (see below), especially for large data sets. This is great in principle, but in practice most biological data are heterogeneous and thus must be stored as a data frame. Lastly, nearly all of the packages that we will use in R only work with data frames. We will work with data frames almost exclusively for the remainder of the course.

## Data Frames
A data frame is a fancy way of saying data table with one caveat; we need to keep in mind that the data in a frame can be of multiple types as defined by R. This should make good sense as we often want to analyze relationships between numerical values, logical values, integers, etc. and this isn't possible in a data matrix. In most respects, working with data frames is just easier.  

Load the tidyverse.
```{r echo=T, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

Here is the vector of organisms.
```{r}
organism<-c("Human","Mouse","Fruit Fly", "Roundworm","Yeast")
```

Here are the data.
```{r}
genomeSizeBP<-c(3000000000,3000000000,135600000,97000000,12100000)
estGeneCount<-c(30000,30000,13061,19099,6034)
```

Instead of using the matrix command, we will combine the data using `data.frame()`.
```{r}
comparativeGenomeSize<- data.frame(organism=organism, genomeSizeBP=genomeSizeBP, estGeneCount=estGeneCount)
comparativeGenomeSize
```
Notice that not only are the data neater and cleaner looking, there is also information provided about the type of data in the frame. dbl just means that the value is a type of numeric [double precision floating point](http://uc-r.github.io/integer_double/).
